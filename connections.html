    <h3>Written 3 December, 2025</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        "15 judges. 71 participants. All gathered in one lecture hall to see groups present a startup that one week ago didn't even exist."
    </p>
    <p>
        This is what is racing through your mind as you stand in deafening silence. In five minutes, the startup that you've been working 
        on nonstop will be evaluated alongside four other highly capable MVPs. The pressure is suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
        But then your eyes break away from the crowd, darting towards your team. On your left is your team leader, who managed to get an
        initial user base and prove the viability of your product. On your right is your marketing specialist, who relentlessly promoted online
        engagement, reaching over 200 followers and 15 thousand impressions in a remarkably short timeframe. And behind you, still setting up the slide deck, is your backend
        developer, a technical prodigy that put in long nights to get the project's agentic interface working just in time for the demo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through hardship and failure, you formed a startup that with patience and dedication could turn into something beautiful. Now your task
        is to convince people of that potential.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <b><i>So how do you pitch it?</i></b>
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        It's still strange to me that I landed myself in this situation. All of it originated from an innocent question from one of my friends
        in Sauder.
    </p>
    <p>
        "There's this really cool startup event hosted by BizTech, where you have an idea, build it, and actually launch it. Would you
        at all be interested in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to be honest: I really didn't have much interest in it initially. It was only after I inquired about his idea for the competition
        that I really began to consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of us have an intrinsic understanding that true learning only happens when we're in a community. Yes, you can spend hours reading books
        and researching articles, but mastery only comes when you start applying it. And that requires you to talk to people. This is why schools and
        universities are formed: to have those conversations revolving around academia. But there's an untapped pool of knowledge that goes beyond
        classrooms. Think about it. Every person you pass down the street knows something that you don't. Likewise, you know something that people
        you interact with don't. And knowledge pays, especially in the information age.
    </p>
    <p>
        What this should tell you is that your community is your greatest asset. And this isn't a new development. For centuries, we've operated on the
        basis that your community would help raise and grow its members, with the expectation that individuals would give back. And
        this alone was enough for people to prosper. Today, that ideal isn't as clear. People are atomized, and this is reflected in learning opportunities
        as well. Many schools prioritize standardization instead of collaboration. And online certifications and courses are no better; all you're doing
        in these environments is following directions. The result? Record high dropout rates and a general feeling of incompetence among people.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that's what we're offering people. Connections. Yeah, that's the name of the startup. Real clever.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connections works by capitalizing on a double market, a business model that has seen success with other companies like DoorDash and Airbnb. 
        To oversimplify what the platform does, we match relevant instructors and attendees together based on their learning preferences and where
        they're located through in-person events. What this accomplishes is providing instructors an audience where they can monitize their skills
        without having to deal with branding, marketing, and outreach. At the same time, learners get higher quality learning experiences without 
        barriers. And ultimately, what Connections accomplishes is it helps maintain a healthy social infrastructure for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that's the 'why' behind Connections. My job is to answer the 'how'. I was tasked with the front-end of Connections, rounding out our two person
        dev team for KickStart. Which is great, that's what I'm good at. But it was still very daunting for me. I'm new to software development.
        In fact, I was still working on this website when I was asked to join the team. So I only had one (1) unpublished project that was relevant. And I was
        being asked to design a web app that would host event posts, messaging, account and profile management, and backend integration. Yeesh, I got my work
        cut out for me. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonetheless, we worked hard to make this idea come to reality. planning, developing, building. Then debating, leading to revision of our model.
        Then consulting with coaches. More revision. Breaking and building until finally Wednesday came. Judgement day.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        <b><i>How we pitched it</i></b>
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Poorly.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's... Difficult. To come so far only to slump at the point where it mattered most. Despite making it as a finalist, there was no prize. There
        were no coaches or judges that reached out afterward. Being a 'finalist' was just an honorary title.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moments after the winners were announced, people began to shuffle out of the lecture hall, fatigued from the work that this competition required
        of them. My team walked out of the CPA hall, albeit feeling more sour than we anticipated. I gave some assurance that we can recover from this, and
        then we parted ways. Now I'm alone, save for the cold Vancouver wind, as I walk back to my dorm.
    </p>
    <p>
        "What now?" I thought. Though it didn't take me long to find an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter where you placed, everyone that night now had a startup that launched. And that's the most valuable asset that anyone could ask for.
        With enough dedication and creativity, there's nothing stopping us from taking Connections and expanding it. It won't be easy. We'll face
        plenty more rejections besides KickStart. But it will be real. People will use it, and Connections will be made. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These next four years will be a tial by fire. Both within Connections and outside of it, I will be doing things that I'm genuinely not qualified
        for. But I'm not running away from it. Every time Connections or another project breaks, I will too. And every time these projects is rebuilt, I
        will too. And this will continue to happen until what seemed impossible at first is now mundane. Until nobody can deny me what I've earned.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So yeah! That's where I'm at with this project. If you're at all interested in watching Connections develop, I highly recommend checking out
        our <a href="https://www.connectionsforcommunity.org" target="_blank">website here</a> and our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/connections_for_community/" target="_blank">Instagram profile here</a>.

    <p>
        I Also wanted to thank a few people. Thank you Aaron, Arturo, and Jugaad for being amazing Co-Founders. Looking forward to many more interactions
        as we continue to grow Connections. Thank you Aaron Stuart and Ash Gozli for showing initial interest in our enterprise. Your support has been
        essential as we build up our credibility. And finally, thank you BizTech for hosting KickStart and for fostering UBC entrepreneurship.
